            In this blog post I am sharing 17 high vibration mineral varieties that aid in our spiritual growth and Ascension. It was hard to narrow it down to just these seventeen, so I went with the crystals I gravitated towards working with the most throughout 2020.

 

These crystals help connect to higher consciousness, activate and receive downloads of information from higher dimensional realms and star systems. These crystals are libraries of codes containing ancient and galactic knowledge.

 

Ascension is the enlightenment process, as we individually and collectively, together with Gaia ascend the limits of third dimensional reality and reclaim our multidimensional selves, activating our crystalline light body and awakening to 5D consciousness. 5D is not a physical place in the way we perceive the physical from a 3D perspective. We cannot fully comprehend or explain 5D within the limits of our 3D senses. It is a higher dimensional consciousness to be experienced through reaching higher vibrational state.

 

Crystals are tools for interpreting and working with sacred geometry, symbology, sacred numbers, synchronicity, ancient sacred texts to expand knowledge to align with your purpose and galactic mission.

 

Crystal are tools for activating a higher state of consciousness, assisting in meditation, astral travel, channelling, and communicating with beings from higher dimensional realms.

By establishing harmonic resonance, raising your vibrational frequency to match the higher frequencies of the crystal, activates the higher self and increases intuitive abilities. Work with these crystals for supporting the healing necessary for Ascension and helping to overcome Ascension symptoms.
