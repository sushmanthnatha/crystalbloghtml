            Crystals and minerals with trace amounts of lithium in their elemental makeup have a deeply relaxing, tranquil energy.

The minerals listed below all contain trace amounts of lithium and so the effects are felt on a subtle, energetic level, and are safe for all. Lithium is used in mental health medications for its tranquilizing and mood stabilizing effects. *See disclaimer below.

In this article I focus on Lithium bearing minerals and their relaxing energy that I have personally experienced. I find these crystals help with easing anxiety, relieving stress, tension and balancing mood. There are many minerals that aren’t Lithium bearing that can also help to calm feelings of anxiety and stress. I have listed some of my favourites at the end of this article.

Work with Lithium bearing crystals to aid in relieving emotional distress, balancing mood, relaxing an overworked mind and body, evoking feelings of bliss, inner peace and calm.

Hold, carry or wear these crystals to help release all of the thoughts, emotions and energies we pick up throughout the day.

Hold them to your heart to ease tension and calm the emotional body and nervous system.

Lithium bearing minerals can also aid in restless sleep, insomnia and sleep disturbances. Keep these crystals by your bed, or under your pillow to ease into a peaceful, restful deep sleep.
